# Agent for Prediction: Text-to-Model (T2M)
Overview
Building AI-backed prediction models from scratch is challenging, especially for users without a technical background. To empower these users, we introduce a transformative approach called Text-to-Model (T2M). This paradigm simplifies the model creation process, enabling users to describe their needs and provide data in textual form, which our system then transforms into a high-performance predictive model.

Market Context
The global artificial intelligence market was estimated at USD 196.65 billion in 2023 and is expected to surpass around USD 4,691.89 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 37.33% from 2024 to 2033. This explosive growth underscores the vast potential and critical importance of accessible AI solutions, like the T2M system, in various industries worldwide.

Key Features
User-Friendly Interaction: Simple text-based input for describing prediction needs and data submission.
Advanced Data Processing: Automated data cleaning and preparation for optimal model training.
